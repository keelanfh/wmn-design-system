      <p>Components are reusable parts of the user interface that have been made to support a variety of applications.</p>

      <p>Individual components can be used in multiple different patterns and contexts. For example, the text input component can be used to ask for an email address, a National Insurance number or someoneâ€™s name.</p>
      <p>If you are using the GOV.UK Prototype Kit or have GOV.UK Frontend included in your build, the coded examples provided will render exactly as they do inside the Design System.</p>
