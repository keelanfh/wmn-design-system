## WMN Styleguide [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/dff99875-8f09-42b9-bb99-3a43f8c0e697/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/wmca/deploys)

Welcome to the [West Midlands Network Design System](https://wmnetwork.netlify.com/).

- Tailored for building West Midlands Network apps and websites: Using the WMN Design System markup and CSS framework results in UIs that reflect the West Midlands Network look and feel.
- Continuously updated: As long as youâ€™re using the latest version of the WMN Design System, your pages are always up to date with Salesforce UI changes.

## Quick start

1. Clone the project with `git clone git@bitbucket.org:wmca/west-midlands-network.git`
2. Run `npm install` in the root folder.
3. Run `npm start` to launch the dev enviornment with hotreloading.
4. Visit http://localhost:3000

## Previewer

<img src="docs/previewer.v1.jpg" alt="previewer blueprint/variant/modifier selection" width="600px"/>

The previewer is an interactive tool for creating blueprints.

It runs at the designated url on startup and is the primary means of viewing your work - it will live update as you make changes.

You can choose the blueprint, variant, and modifiers to preview as well as background color and screen size. It also previews the sass docs.

Everything in the design system is driven by [annotations](guidelines/ANNOTATIONS.md) and the previewer is no different. **To see any work in the previewer, you must add annotations to your code.**

## Annotations

See the <a href="guidelines/ANNOTATIONS.md">annotations guide</a>.

## Blueprint Documentation

See the <a href="guidelines/BLUEPRINT_DOCUMENTATION.md">blueprint documentation guide</a>.

## Tasks

```

### Pull Request Checks

To run all the checks a pull request will run in Travis use the following command.

```bash
# To run every check against all blueprints
npm run pr-checks

# To run every check but target certain blueprints for slow checks like aXe and vnu
npm run pr-checks -- --components button,path,trees
```
