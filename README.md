## 1.2. WMN Styleguide

Welcome to the [West Midlands Network Design System](https://wmnetwork.netlify.com/).

The WMN Styleguide is ran at the designated url on startup (usually [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)) and is the primary means of viewing your work - it will live update as you make changes.

-   Tailored for building West Midlands Network apps and websites: Using the WMN Design System markup and CSS framework results in UIs that reflect the West Midlands Network look and feel.
-   Continuously updated: As long as you're using the latest version of the WMN Design System, your pages are always up to date with Salesforce UI changes.
